    <p class="about-text">
      Soccer improves our physical health. It's a game that demands agility, endurance, and strength. From running
      across the field to executing precise kicks, every aspect of soccer contributes to our overall fitness.
      But soccer isn't just about physical fitness; it's also about mental and emotional well-being. Soccer teaches us
      the importance of teamwork, discipline, and resilience. On the field, we learn to communicate effectively,
      collaborate with others, and support our teammates.

    <p class="about-text"> Gym sessions provide an excellent opportunity to de-stress and unwind from the pressures of
      daily life. Exercise releases endorphins, often referred to as "feel-good" hormones, which can alleviate stress,
      anxiety, and even symptoms of depression.
      Moreover, the gym fosters discipline and consistency. Committing to a regular workout schedule requires dedication
      and perseverance.
